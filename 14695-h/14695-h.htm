    <h2>MORE THAN SATISFIED!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>With Mr. Punch's apologies to the Daily Telegraph's
    "Academic Enthusiast</i>.")</h4>

    <p>"She-Pantaloons? seedy? Now, do we <i>look</i> like it?"</p>

    <p>The speaker was a tall, robust maiden with fair hair; on her
    knee was an edition (without notes) of the <i>Anabasis of
    Xenophon</i>, and by her side was <i>Liddell and Scott's
    Lexicon</i>, in which she had just been tracking an
    exceptionally difficult&mdash;but, let me hasten to add, a
    perfectly regular&mdash;Greek verb to its lair. There were a
    considerable number of roseate specimens of English womanhood
    in the library of Girnham College, where, with some natural
    diffidence, I had ventured to put the rather delicate question
    to which I received the above reply.</p>

    <p>For I had been much troubled in my soul about Sir JAMES
    CRICHTON BROWNE's recent deliverances with regard to the
    injurious physical effect of the Higher Education upon women,
    and, as a devoted&mdash;if hitherto unappreciated&mdash;admirer
    of the Fair Sex, I felt I had a theoretical interest in the
    question, and was bound to verify Dr. BROWNE's views. The most
    obvious way of satisfying my anxiety was to go to Girnham
    myself and ask the lady students what <i>they</i> thought about
    it, and so I did.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/241.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/241.png"
             alt="'I received the football in the pit of my stomach.'" />
        </a>"I received the football in the pit of my stomach."
    </div>

    <p>"I quite agree," I said, mildly, as I unwound my comforter,
    "that your course of studies seems to suit you remarkably well.
    Quite a bevy of female admirable CRICHT&mdash;!"</p>

    <p>The effect was immediate; an unmistakable rush of
    lexicons&mdash;or were they Todhunters?&mdash;hurtled around my
    devoted head from the fair hands of disturbed and ruffled
    girlhood.</p>

    <p>"Pray don't mention that person again!" said my fair-haired
    interlocutor, and I thought I wouldn't.</p>

    <p>"Well, but," I began, with heroic daring, as I laid aside my
    respirator, "as to weak <i>chests</i> now?"</p>

    <p>I was interrupted by a paroxysm of coughing, which I tried
    to explain, as my young friends thumped my back with
    unnecessary zeal, was, owing to my having imprudently ventured
    out without my chest-protector. As soon as I was able, I feebly
    hazarded the suggestion that, for growing girls, the habit of
    stooping over their books seemed calculated to induce weakness
    in the lungs&mdash;but their roars of merriment at the idea
    instantly convinced me that any uneasiness on this score was
    entirely superfluous.</p>

    <p>"You certainly all look remarkably well," I observed,
    genially, "particularly sunburnt and brow&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Here there was a roar of quite another kind. I endeavoured
    to protest, as I got behind an arm-chair and dodged a
    Differential Calculus and a large glass inkstand, that I hadn't
    meant to allude to the obnoxious Physician at all, but had
    merely intended to convey my hearty admir&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I know what you're going to say!" interrupted the
    fair-haired girl, vivaciously. "And you had better not."</p>

    <p>As she spoke, she raised me from my seat by the coat-collar
    with no apparent effort, and deposited me on the top of a tall
    bookcase, from which I found myself compelled to prosecute my
    inquiries.</p>

    <p>"Nature has been very bountiful to you&mdash;very much so, I
    am sure," I murmured, blinking amiably down upon them through
    the spectacles I wear to correct a slight tendency to
    strabismus. "Still, don't you&mdash;er&mdash;find that your
    eyes&mdash;"</p>

    <p>I got no further; I thought some of them would have
    died!</p>

    <p>"How about the effect of learning on your <i>looks</i>,
    now?" I next inquired. "Is it true that classical and
    mathematical pursuits are apt to exercise a disfiguring effect?
    Not that, with such blooming faces as I see around
    me&mdash;er&mdash;if you will allow me to say so&mdash;"</p>

    <p>But they wouldn't; on the contrary, I was given to
    understand, somewhat plainly, that compliments were perhaps
    ill-advised in that gathering.</p>

    <p>"Are you&mdash;hem&mdash;fond of athletics?" was the
    question I put next from my lofty perch. "Do you go in for
    <i>games</i> at all, now?"</p>

    <p>"Of course we do!" said the fair-haired girl, affording a
    practical demonstration of the fact by taking me down and
    proceeding with her lively companions to engage in the old
    classical game of <i>pila</i> or
    &sigma;&phi;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&eta;,
    the recreation in which Ulysses long ago found Nausicaa engaged
    with her maidens. On this occasion, however, <i>I</i>
    represented the <i>pila</i>, or ball, and although, in justice
    to their accuracy of eye and hand, I am bound to admit that I
    was seldom allowed to touch the ground as I sped swiftly from
    one to the other, still I felt considerable relief when, on my
    urgent protestations that I was fully convinced of their
    proficiency in this amusement, they were prevailed upon to
    bring this pastime to a close.</p>

    <p>"We are breaking the rule of silence in this room," said the
    fair-haired one. "And you <i>do</i> ask such a lot of
    questions! But, as you seem curious about our athletic
    pursuits, come and I will try to show you."</p>

    <p>I crawled after my guide without a word, inwardly reflecting
    that I was sorry I had spoken, and heartily cursing (though
    without pronouncing it aloud) the very name of that eminent
    Physician, Dr. CRICHTON BROWNE. She took me first of all to a
    field where a bevy of maidens were engaged in a game of
    hockey.</p>

    <p>"We are keen on hockey," said my guide, and, as she spoke, a
    girl, flushed and radiant, caught me across the most sensitive
    part of the shin with a hockey-stick. No need to ask <i>her</i>
    if she felt well. I limped away, and, in another part of the
    field, saw a comely and robust maiden practising drop-kicks,
    utterly regardless of the fact that I was looking on. I
    received the football in the pit of my stomach, and the name of
    CRICHTON BROWNE died on my lips.</p>

    <p>My guide smiled as she saw that I had taken in the scene
    that was being enacted under my very nose.</p>

    <p>"Do you play cricket?" she asked, with something like pity
    in her eyes. I did <i>not</i>&mdash;but I was by this time in
    such condign fear of this young Amazon that I was really afraid
    to admit my total ignorance of the sport. She made me
    wicket-keep for her, <i>without</i> pads, for an entire hour,
    at the end of which I readily assented to an invitation for
    further exploration.</p>

    <p>We went through endless passages to an endless gymnasium,
    and every now and then I came across an Indian club or a
    dumb-bell, wielded by energetic female athletes. I should have
    liked to ask them whether they felt well, but I
    realised&mdash;only just in time&mdash;that the question would
    have been an impertinence.</p>

    <p>"Are you getting satisfied?" said my unwearied guide, with
    another of her smiles, "or, do you still think we are a puny
    misshapen race?"</p>

    <p>"Quite satisfied!" I replied, faintly, as I endeavoured to
    unclose a rapidly discolouring eye, "in fact, I begin to
    discredit that alarmist cry&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Before I could complete the sentence, I found myself
    executing an involuntary parabola over some adjacent parallel
    bars. My young friend's brows had contracted into a frown,
    although she waited politely for me to pick myself up.</p>

    <p>"I thought we agreed not to mention that name!" she said,
    coldly.</p>

    <p>I felt that any attempt to explain my innocence would be
    received with quiet scorn. "I&mdash;I should like to ask you
    just one thing more," I said, desperately, as I lay on my back,
    "I am really entirely converted&mdash;quite ashamed. I do hope
    you won't think me&mdash;er&mdash;inquisitive&mdash;but I have
    been so often told&mdash;it has been so constantly
    asserted&mdash;" I found myself bungling horribly in my desire
    not to offend.</p>

    <p>"Pray go on," she said, "we try to be simple and sincere,
    and we are always ready to satisfy an intelligent
    inquirer."</p>

    <p>"Well," I said, desperately, "people <i>do</i> say that you
    all wear&mdash;er&mdash;blue stockings. But I am sure," I added
    quickly, "that it is not true" ...</p>

    <p>It was too late. When the friend who had smuggled me into
    the building came to my rescue, he asked me, rather noisily,
    "if I was feeling well?" I replied that I was not, and that I
    did not think I ever should again. And I never have.</p>

    <h2>MEMS. OF THEATRES, &amp;C., COMMISSION.</h2>

    <p>Mr. John Hare, Lessee of the Garrick Theatre, in his
    evidence before the Theatres and Music Halls Committee,
    described himself, according to the <i>Times</i> Report, as
    having "been for about thirty years an actor, and for fifteen
    years a manager." This gives him forty-five years of
    professional life, and saying, for example, that he commenced
    his career as an actor at twenty, then his own computation
    brings him up to sixty-five If this be so, then Mr. JOHN HARE,
    with his elastic step, his twinkling eye, his clear
    enunciation, and his energetic style, is the youngest
    sexagenarian to be met with on or off the stage; and it is
    probable that when he reaches the Gladstonian age he will be
    more sprightly than even the Grand One himself.</p>

    <p>In answer to a question put by Viscount EBRINGTON, Mr.
    EDWARD TERRY gave it as his opinion that "if officers"&mdash;he
    was speaking of the army not the police&mdash;"were prouder of
    their uniforms, and did not take the earliest opportunity of
    divesting themselves of them, the uniform would be more
    respected." He ought to have put it, "would be uniformly more
    respected." But how about the man inside the uniform? But why
    should a soldier wear his uniform when off duty any more than a
    policeman when off duty, or any more than a barrister should
    wear his wig, bands, and gown, when not practising in the
    Courts? There is one person who should always wear a
    distinctive uniform, and that is a Clergyman, who is never off
    duty. Perhaps this is already provided for by the Act of
    Uniformity.</p>

    <p>Mr. JOHN HOLLINGSHEAD, after expressing his opinion that Mr.
    IRVING had been "seeing visions,"&mdash;which of course is
    quite an Irvingite characteristic,&mdash;proposed to put
    everything right everywhere, and be the Universal Legislator
    and Official Representative of Everybody. Salary not so much an
    object as a comfortable home, a recognised official position,
    and "No Fees." (The Commission still sitting may perhaps
    dissolve itself, and appoint the last witness as Sole
    Theatrical and Music Hall Commissioner, with no power to add to
    his number.)</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 9</i>.&mdash;House dealt
    with just now after manner of Horticultural Exhibition at
    Earl's Court. Laid out as three acres, through which JESSE
    COLLINGS might be expected to lead the cow. But, as SQUIRE OF
    MALWOOD (a great authority on stock matters) says, the esteemed
    quadruped is dead, abandoned by its protector at time of
    disruption of Liberal Party. Exists now only in the form of
    carcass, to be found rather in butchers' shops than on quiet
    pastures. Pity, this. Difficult to imagine any better
    arrangement for what theatrical people call "properties" than
    the cow&mdash;probably with a blue ribbon round its
    neck&mdash;led through three acres of green meadow by JESSE
    COLLINGS, in clean smock-frock, with a crook in his hand.</p>

    <p>Dr. CLARK says they don't drive cattle with crooks. But
    that's a detail. CLARK sure to contradict in any case.</p>

    <p>Things very quiet to-night; quite pastoral. Only one
    outburst; that arose when FOSTER accused CHAMBERLAIN of saying
    the thing that is not. CHAMBERLAIN hotly rose, and appealed to
    Chairman to say whether the Doctor-Baronet was in order.
    COURTNEY said, since he was asked, he must say he thought not.
    So FOSTER changed the prescription. CHAPLIN much gratified at
    this speedy close of rupture that threatened progress with
    Bill. Presided over discussion with urbanity that was
    irresistible.</p>

    <p>"Reminds me," said WILFRID LAWSON, looking across at Right
    Hon. Gentleman seated on Treasury Bench, with deeply-bayed
    shirt-front, and head closely bent over copy of Bill, "of a
    motherly hen gathering its brood under its wings, and trying to
    make things comfortable all round. Sometimes, when one of the
    brood grows a trifle importunate, the motherly expression on
    the expansive face sharpens, and the chicken is pecked at. But,
    on the whole, little to disturb the serenity of the coop."</p>

    <p>Never before thought of CHAPLIN as an old hen. But, really,
    with the place permeated with agricultural and farm-yard
    associations, LAWSON's idea not so far out of it as it might
    appear to the domestic circle at Blankney Hall.</p>

    <p>At half-past eleven those Scotchmen came up again. Upset the
    henroost, devoured what was left of the cow, dug up the
    verdurous three acres, and till two o'clock in the morning
    harried the Commissioners under the Scotch University Act.

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Don't know what we shall do when
    WIGGIN leaves us, as he threatens to do after Dissolution. Not
    much here just now, but sometimes his face seen in House or
    Lobbies, piercing surrounding gloom like what SWIFT MACNEILL
    distantly alludes to as "the orb of day." Only WIGGIN could
    have thought of the little <i>divertissement</i> that for a few
    moments raised depressed spirits of House this afternoon.
    Resumed at morning Sitting (so called because it takes place in
    the afternoon) discussion of Small Holdings Bill.
    SEALE-HAYNE,&mdash;whose reputation as a humorist still lingers
    a tradition in the playing fields at Eton, but whose subsequent
    political career has subdued his vivacity,&mdash;moved
    Amendment. Something about compensation for cow-sheds. COBB
    airily addressed the Committee; and CHAPLIN whispered a few
    confidential remarks across Table.</p>

    <p>Curious how this "eminent authority," as the MARKISS calls
    quite another personage, has lost his voice since Bill got into
    Committee. Seems so awestruck by enormity of his
    responsibility, not inclined to raise his voice above whisper.
    Effort to catch purport of his remarks completed depression
    under which Committee sinking. Went out to vote as if they were
    conducting CHAPLIN to a too early funeral. Then it was that an
    idea dawned on the mind of the wanton WIGGIN.</p>

    <p>"<i>I</i>'ll show 'em sport, TOBY, dear boy," he said to me
    in passing. "<i>I</i>'ll give their spirits a leg up!"</p>

    <p>Forgotten about this in passing through Division Lobby;
    coming back startled by angry roar. COURTNEY on his feet
    solemnly shouting "Order, Order!" like minute-gun at sea.
    Nothing came of this; excitement increased; COURTNEY crying
    "Order, Order!" in sterner voice. Looked about for explanation,
    and lo! there was the waggish WIGGIN with his hat cocked well
    on one side of his head, waddling down the floor of the House
    past the Chair. You may do almost anything in the House of
    Commons but walk about with your hat on, and here was WIGGIN,
    not only doing it, but persisting in the offence, smiling back
    innocently on the increasing circle of Members roaring at him,
    and COURTNEY, with increasing stridency, shouting "Order!"
    behind his back. Having got nearly to the Bar, the wily WIGGIN,
    affecting to wonder what all the row was about, turned round
    and found himself pierced through and through with the flaming
    eye of outraged Chairman. Pretty to see how, all of a sudden,
    it seemed to flash upon him that <i>he</i> was the culprit, and
    that it was his hat at which Members, like so many WILLIAM
    TELLS, were persistently tiring. The sunset face flushed deeper
    still; with quick movement the wayward WIGGIN removed his
    offending hat, and, bowing apologetically to the Chair, went
    forth with quickened pace.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:26%;">

    </div>

    <p>Excellently done; took in the whole House, including
    Chairman. But WIGGIN's benevolent intention secured, and, if
    only temporarily, spirits of House jubilantly rose. <i>Business
    done</i>.&mdash;In Committee on Small Holdings.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Municipal Corporations Act, 1882
    (Amendment) Bill first Order of Day. Doesn't seem to promise
    anything exciting; Debate, however, not gone far before
    discovery made that it hides a deep design. Wouldn't think,
    looking at FORWOOD as he sits at remote end of Treasury Bench,
    that he had anything to do with Hecuba, or Hecuba
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"
       id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span> with him. Only suspicious
       thing about him is, his extreme desire to keep out of sight.
       When SPEAKER took Chair he was standing at Bar surveying
       House, and wondering when it would be made. As soon as
       MATTINSON rose to move Second Heading of Bill, FORWOOD. so
       to speak, went backward, and planted himself well in shadow
       of SPEAKER's Chair.</p>

    <p>Turns out in course of interesting Debate that, though the
    speech on moving Second Reading is the voice of MATTINSON, the
    Bill is the Bill of FORWOOD, whose interest in the political
    affairs of Liverpool is said to be extensive and peculiar.
    NEVILLE puts it in another way. "Whenever," he said, "any
    political manipulation is afoot in Liverpool, be sure the
    Secretary to the Admiralty will not be far away."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:18%;">

             alt="'This Way to London!'" /></a>"This Way to
             London!"
    </div>

    <p>At first, FORWOOD affected indifference to proceedings. "His
    Bill! s'elp him, never seen it before. 'L'pool.' What's that?"
    But as Debate went forward, and gentlemen opposite insisted on
    dragging him in, he finally yielded, and taking off coat, "went
    for" other side. Rev. SAM SMITH interposed with charming story
    about a gentleman whom Liverpool Tories had appointed Chairman
    of Watch Committee, "he being solicitor to the two largest
    publicans in Liverpool." That didn't at first sight seem much
    to point, supposing even the united cubit measurement of the
    worthy tradesmen exceeded twelve feet. But Reverend SAM went on
    to explain what he meant was that, "between them, they owned
    about 120 public-houses." Curious movement in Strangers'
    Gallery as of involuntary smacking of many lips, FORWOOD said
    this (which he daintily alluded to as "an allegation") had been
    denied. SAM, couching the retort in clerical language, said in
    effect, "You're another!" whereupon Ministerialists roared,
    "Oh! oh!" and FORWOOD, now thoroughly roused, proceeded to show
    that SAMUEL and his Liberal allies were the real Gerrymanders,
    and that he, FORWOOD, was the spotless advocate of the true
    interests of the Working-Man.</p>

    <p>House began to look askance on S.S. Never suspected him of
    being a man of that kind. Glad when painful discussion came to
    end. Bill read Second Time; but jubilation of promoters
    suddenly chilled by TIM HEALY, of whom no one was thinking at
    the moment, stepping in and adroitly putting spoke in wheel of
    Bill, by moving to refer it to Select Committee; which, being
    translated, means it will get no Forwooder this Session.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;TIM HEALY puts FORWOOD's clock
    back.</p>

    trip. Pleased to find his Bill giving the Manchester,
    Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway direct access to London
    passed all its stages in the Commons.</p>

    <p>"It's a new way to London, good TOBY," he said, when I
    congratulated him on the double event. "Some gentlemen who
    faint in St. John's Wood objected on what I believe are called
    æsthetical grounds. But there are several big towns between
    here and Sheffield wanted the short cut, and I determined they
    should have it. Things looked bad last Session, and perhaps
    some fellows would have given up. I have a little way of never
    giving up, and it's astonishing how far it'll carry you. We're
    not through the Lords yet,&mdash;though, as you say, we are
    through their cricket-ground. But you'll see, before twelve
    months are over, I'll bring a train straight from Sheffield
    into our own station in London, and if you only live a little
    longer, you shall come with me on the first trip from Charing
    Cross to Paris under the Channel Tunnel. Everything, TOBY,
    <i>cher ami</i>, comes to the man who won't wait."</p>

    <h2>TRAMWAYS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>From the Newspapers of the Future.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>April</i> 2, 1894.&mdash;The County Council at
    yesterday's meeting discussed the proposed new Tramway from
    Westminster Bridge to the Round Pond, through the Abbey, St.
    James's Park and Rotten Row. Deputations from all the artistic
    and archæological Societies presented petitions against it, but
    the Council refused to read them. Deputations from the
    Institute of Architects and the Society for the Protection of
    Ancient Buildings also attended to give their views on the
    partial demolition of the Abbey, but they quarrelled so much
    amongst themselves that it was necessary to eject them, in
    order to prevent a free fight in the Council Chamber. Three
    Labour Candidates were then received, the Council standing
    respectfully, and stated that at least twenty-seven persons
    residing in Southwark would benefit by the direct route to
    Kensington Gardens. It was at once resolved that the Tramway
    should be made.</p>

    <p><i>May</i> 2, 1901.&mdash;Yesterday an immense Demonstration
    of Working-Men was held in Hyde Park to protest against the
    extension of the Tramways. Mr. JOHN SCALDS presided, and
    observed in his speech, "What is the good of taking the
    Working-Man from his own door to a park, if there is no park at
    the other end, only asphalte and tramlines and some stumps of
    trees cut down? What is the good of taking him to Westminster
    Abbey, if Poets' Corner has been made into a tramcar-shed?
    Besides, now the Working-Man is so much richer, and pays no
    rates or taxes, he does not want trams. They are only fit for
    the miserable Middle Class, and who cares about them?" This was
    greeted with loud shouts of, "Down with the Council!" and the
    vast assemblage marched with threatening cries and gestures
    towards the recently completed County Council Offices. Our
    readers are aware that this sumptuous building, which cost over
    two millions, occupies the site where St. Paul's Cathedral
    formerly stood. It was found, however, that the Council had
    suddenly adjourned, and that all the officials had fled. The
    workmen accordingly entered, and, having voted Mr. SCALDS to
    the chair, unanimously resolved that all the Tramways should be
    removed and the Parks replanted and returfed. It was decided
    that nothing could be done to replace the Cathedral or the
    Abbey, but it was resolved that the following inscription
    should be placed on the ruins at Westminster:&mdash;"To the
    lasting disgrace of the English Nation, this Building, together
    with the other beautiful and interesting parts of London, was
    ruined, for the sake of some impossible and imbecile schemes,
    by an assemblage of the most Despicable Dolts that ever
    lived."</p>

    <h2>OUR COOKERY-BOOKERY.</h2>

    <p>Most Cookery-Books are bosh. I have read them all&mdash;from
    the
    '&Alpha;&rho;&chi;&iota;&mu;&alpha;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;
    of FRANCATELLIDES (1904 B.C.) to the <i>Ayer Akberi</i>: or
    <i>Million Recipes of RUNG JUNG JELLYBAG</i>, compiled in
    Sanskrit, Pali, Singhali, Urdu, Hindustani, Bengali, and the
    Marowsky language, for the "Kitchens measureless to man" (see
    COALRIDGE), of the Golden Dome of Kubla Khan; from Mrs. GLASSE
    to Dr. KITCHENER; from UDE to ALEXANDRE DUMAS; from CARÊME to
    Mrs. MARKHAM (who is said to have adopted the pseudonym of
    "RUNDELL" for her culinary mistress-piece); and from Miss ACTON
    (who was also the distinguished authoress of <i>Austen Fryers,
    Pies and Prejudice, Sense and Saltcellars</i>, &amp;c.) to
    SOYER. The only modern culinary manual which (<i>with one
    exception</i>) is worth anything is by Mrs. DE SALIS, whose
    name has a happy affinity to that of The Only Trustworthy
    Authority as a Cookery-Bookerist, and whose immortal
    contributions to mageiristic lore are appearing weekly in
    <i>Sal&mdash;&mdash; (Here the M.S. is firmly scored out by the
    Editorial blue pencil; but, faintly legible, is, "circulation,
    2,599,862-3/8."</i>) From this "Golden Treasury" of
    gormandising I have been permitted to cull a few recipes. Here
    are two or three for scholastic bed-room suppers. The first
    will be invaluable in Seminaries for Young Ladies:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:55%;">
        <a href="images/249.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/249.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p><i>Saucissons en Petite Toilette.</i>&mdash;Purchase your
    sausages on the sly, and keep them carefully in your glove-box,
    or your handkerchief case till wanted. Prick them all over with
    a hair-pin before cooking. Sprinkle them lightly with violet
    powder, and fry in cold cream (bear's grease will do as well)
    on the back of your handglass over the bed-room candle. If the
    glass gets broken, say it was the housemaid, or the cat did it.
    Turn with the curling-tongs. When done to a rich golden brown,
    put your sausages on a neatly folded copy of S&mdash;&mdash;
    (<i>Editorial blue pencil again</i>), and serve hot. Thin bread
    and butter, plum-cake or shortbread may accompany this
    appetising dish, and a partially ripe apple munched between
    each sausage will certainly give it a zest; but it would
    perhaps be as well not to eat too many chocolate creams
    afterwards.</p>

    <p><i>Soufflé de Fromage de Hollande.</i>&mdash;This is a very
    favourite dish for the dormitory in Young Gentlemen's schools.
    Procure, on credit, a fine Dutch cheese, keep it carefully in
    your play-box or in your desk; but don't let your white mice
    get at it. Before cooking in the dormitory, you and your young
    friends can have a nice game of ball with the merry Dutchman,
    only refrain from trying his relative hardness or softness by
    hammering the head of MUGG, the stupidest boy in the school,
    with it. Now cut up your cheese into small dice and carefully
    toast them on a triangular piece of slate, which you will cause
    "GYP Minor" to hold over a spirit-lamp. When, as the slate
    grows hotter, "GYP Minor" will probably howl, box his ears
    smartly, and the cheese will thus become a "<i>soufflé</i>," or
    rather "<i>soufflet</i>." Serve <i>à la main chaude</i>, but I
    must indignantly protest against the practice of some youths of
    eating peppermint drops with this "<i>plat</i>." A bath bun is
    much better. Beverage, gingerbeer or a little ginger wine.</p>

    <p><i>Tournedos à la Busby.</i>&mdash;It is a very astonishing
    thing that I never could persuade school-boys that this is a
    most succulent, scholastic supper-dish, exceptionally brisk and
    pungent in its flavour. Perhaps their aversion to it is based
    on the fact that the <i>tournedos</i> is usually served very
    hot indeed towards the conclusion of the repast by the Rev.
    Principal. It is accompanied by a brown sauce made of a
    <i>bouquet de bouleau</i> full of buds and marinaded in mild
    pickle.</p>

    <p><i>Curried Rabbit.</i>&mdash;Proceed to Ostend and procure a
    rabbit; honestly if possible, but procure it. Pinch its scut or
    bite its ears, and when it exclaims, "Miauw!" it is not a
    genuine rabbit, but a grimalkin in disguise. Some cats are very
    deceitful at heart. Bring your rabbit home, and then send to
    the nearest livery stables and borrow a curry-comb, then
    proceed to curry your rabbit. If Bunny resists, hit him over
    the head with the comb. He will possibly run away to rejoin his
    brethren at Ostend, or in New South Wales; but at all events
    you will have the curry-comb. One can be good and happy without
    returning the things you borrow. See my "Essay on Books,
    Cartes-de-visite, and Umbrellas," in the next number of
    <i>Sala's J&mdash;&mdash;</i> (<i>Editorial blue-pencil
    again</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>Potage à la Jambe de Bois</i> (Wooden-leg
    Soup).&mdash;Procure a fine fresh wooden-leg, one from Chelsea
    is the best. Wash it carefully in six waters, blanch it, and
    trim neatly. Lay it at the bottom of a large pot, into which
    place eight pounds of the undercut of prime beef, half a
    Bayonne ham, two young chickens, and a sweetbread. To these add
    leeks, chervil, carrots, turnips, fifty heads of asparagus, a
    few truffles, a large cow-cabbage, a pint of French beans, a
    peck of very young peas, a tomato cut in slices, some potatoes,
    and a couple of bananas. Pour in three gallons of water, and
    boil furiously till your soup is reduced to about a pint and
    a-half. As it boils, add, drop by drop, a bottle of JULES
    MUMM's Extra Dry, and a gill of Scotch whiskey; then take out
    your wooden leg, which wipe carefully and serve separately with
    a neat frill, which can be easily cut from the cover of
    <i>Sala's Jo&mdash;&mdash;</i> (<i>Editorial blue pencil
    again</i>), round the top. The soup itself is best served in a
    silver tureen, or in a Dresden china punch-bowl. The above
    obviously is intended neither for school-boys nor school-girls,
    nor is it meant for the tables of the wealthy and luxurious. It
    is emphatically a Poor Man's Dish, otherwise it would never
    have found a place in the cookery column of that essentially
    popular periodical, <i>Sala's Journal</i>. Hurrah! the Editor
    has gone out to "chop," and there was no blue pencil to mar the
    last touching allusions. N.B.&mdash;Circulation, eight

    <h3>THE NEW LEARNING.</h3>

    <p>Mr. STUART RENDEL, having stated at Llanfair-Caerecinion
    that "a day with Mr. GLADSTONE was a whole liberal education,"
    the London School Board has at last decided to alter the
    present system completely. After many days' deliberation, it
    has been arranged to hire the Albert Palace and Mr. GLADSTONE
    for a week. It is estimated that during six days, all the
    children now in the London schools can, in detachments, be
    squeezed into the building and spend a day there with the Right
    Honourable Gentleman. Seats will be provided on the platform
    for the Members of the Board, as this instruction would be a
    great benefit to many of them. At the end of the six days the
    present work of the Board will be finished, and it will adjourn
    for ten years, when another week in the society of the Grand
    Old Educator will again suffice for the needs of the rising
    generation. The numerous Board Schools will therefore become
    useless, but it is not proposed to demolish them, as experience
    has shown that they are sure to fall down of their own accord
    before long. The sumptuous offices of the Board will be
    converted into a Home for Destitute Schoolmasters.</p>

    <p>We have reason to believe that Mr. GLADSTONE, after
    fulfilling his engagement at the Albert Palace, will make a
    tour in the provinces, and later on will have classes for
    journalists and other literary men, whose style, in many cases,
    would be vastly improved by two minutes, or even less, in the
    same room with him.</p>

            <p>An Omen in the place there seems to be,</p>

    <p>"Upon what principle," one of my Baronites writes, "do
    people collecting a number of short stories for publication in
    one volume, select that which shall give the book its title?"
    Of course I know, but shan't say; am not here to answer
    conundrums. After interval of chilling silence, my Baronite
    continues, "Lady LINDSAY has brought together ten stories which
    A. &amp; C. BLACK publish in a comely volume. She calls it <i>A
    Philosopher's Window</i>, that being the title of the first in
    the procession. I have looked through the <i>Philosopher's
    Window</i>, and don't see much, except perhaps a reminiscence
    of <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. There are others, far better,
    notably 'Miss Dairsie's Diary.' This is a gem of simple
    narrative, set in charming Scottish scenery, which Lady LINDSAY
    evidently knows and loves. There is much else that is good.
    'The Story of a Railway Journey,' and 'Poor Miss
    Brackenthorpe,' for example. All are set in a minor key, but it
    is simple, natural music."</p>

    <h2>THE YOUNG GIRL'S COMPANION.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mrs. Payley.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. IV.&mdash;THE CHOICE OF A HUSBAND.</h3>

    <p>Any woman, my dear young girls, can marry any man she likes,
    provided that she is careful about two points. She must let him
    know that she would accept a proposal from him, but she must
    never let him know that she has let him know. The encouragement
    must be very strong but very delicate. To let him know that you
    would marry him is to appeal to his vanity, and this appeal
    never fails; but to let him know that you have given him the
    information is to appeal to his pity, and this appeal never
    succeeds. Besides, you awake his disgust. Half the art of the
    woman of the world consists in doing disgusting things
    delicately. Be delicate, be indirect, avoid simplicity, and
    there is hardly any limit to your choice of a husband.</p>

    <p>I need say nothing about detrimental people. The conflict
    between a daughter and her parents on this point&mdash;so
    popular in fiction&mdash;very rarely takes place. It is well
    understood. You may fall in love with the detrimental person,
    and you may let him fall in love with you. But at present we
    are talking about marriage. Never marry a man with the artistic
    temperament. By the artistic temperament one means morbid
    tastes, uncertain temper and excessive vanity. It may be witty
    at dinner; it <i>must</i> be snappish at breakfast. It never
    has any money. In its dress it is dirty and picturesque, unless
    under the pressure of an occasion. It flirts well, but marries
    badly. I have described, of course, rather a pronounced case of
    artistic temperament. But it is hardly safe to marry any man
    who appreciates things artistic, because, as a rule, he only
    does it in order that people may appreciate his appreciation;
    and after a time that becomes wearisome.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:28%;">
        <a href="images/252-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/252-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Do not marry an imperial man. The young girl of seventeen
    believes in strength; by this she means a large chin and a
    persistent neglect of herself. She adores that kind of thing,
    and she will marry it if she is not warned. It is not good to
    fall in love with Restrained Force, and afterwards find that
    you have married Apathy.</p>

    <p>The man whom you marry must, of course, have an income; he
    should have a better social position than you have any right to
    expect. You know all that&mdash;it is a commonplace. But also
    he must be perfectly even. In everything he should remind you
    constantly of most other men. Everything in him and about him
    should be uniform. Even his sins should be so monotonous that
    it is impossible to call them romantic. Avoid the romantic.
    Shun supreme moments. Chocolate-creams are very well, but as a
    daily food dry toast is better. Seek for the man who has the
    qualities of dry toast&mdash;a hard exterior manner, and an
    interior temperament that is at once soft and insipid. The man
    that I describe is amenable to flattery, even as dry toast is
    amenable to butter. You can guide him. And, as he never varies,
    you can calculate upon him. Marry the dry-toast man. He is easy
    to obtain. There are hundreds of him in Piccadilly. None of
    them wants to marry, and all of them will. He gives no trouble.
    He will go to the Club when he wants to talk, and to the
    theatre when he wants to be amused. He will come to you when he
    wants absolutely nothing; and in you&mdash;if you are the
    well-bred English girl that I am supposing&mdash;he will
    assuredly find it. And so you will both be contented.</p>

    <p>Do not think that I am, for one moment, depreciating
    sentiment. I worship it; I am a sentimentalist myself. But
    everything has its place, and sentiment of this kind belongs to
    young unmarried life&mdash;to the period when you are engaged,
    or when you ought to be engaged. The young man whom I have
    described&mdash;the crisp, perfect, insipid, dry-toast
    man&mdash;would only be bored by a wife who wanted to be on
    sentimental terms with him. I remember a case in point. A young
    girl, whom I knew intimately, married a man who was, as a
    husband, perfect. They lived happily enough for three or four
    years; she had a couple of children, a beautiful house,
    everything that could be desired. And then the trouble came.
    She had been reading trashy novels, I suppose; at any rate, she
    fell in love with her own husband. She went in daily dread that
    he would find it out. I argued with her, reasoned with her,
    entreated her to give up such ruinous folly. It was of no use.
    She wrote him letters&mdash;three sheets, crossed and
    underlined. I warned her that sooner or later he would read one
    of them. He did; and he never forgave her. That happy home is
    all broken up now&mdash;simply because that woman could not
    remember that there is a time for sentiment and a time for
    propriety, and that marriage is the time for propriety. The
    passions are all very well until you are married; but the
    fashions will last you all your life.</p>

    <p>I have no more to say on the choice of a husband. It is
    quite the simplest thing that a young girl has to
    learn,&mdash;you must find a quite colourless person, and
    flatter him a little; his vanity will do the rest. And when you
    are married to him, you will find him much easier to tolerate
    than a man who has any strong characteristic. Do not get into
    the habit of thinking marriage important; it is only important
    in so far as it affects externals; it need not touch the
    interior of your life.</p>

    <p>I have received several letters. ELLA has had poetry sent to
    her by her <i>fiancé</i>, and wishes to know if this would
    justify her in breaking the engagement. I think not. She can
    never be quite certain that it is the man's own make; and,
    besides, plenty of men are like that during the engagement
    period, but never suffer from it afterwards. The other letters
    must be answered privately.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
